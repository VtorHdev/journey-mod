[![Journey Intro](https://i.ibb.co/2kTgtBn/journey-intro-1.png)]()

[WIP] My project to turn the singleplayer mode into something much more adapted to play alone, merging the original Diablo experience with a new way of playing. 

It is my first mod and a long-term idea, so I will add changes and additions over time, as I learn.


[![Journey Install](https://i.ibb.co/wKHm2pJ/journey-install-1.png)]()

1) Download `journey.mpq` folder and find d2r installation folder. 
2) Make a directory called "mods" and a a folder "journey" like this -> `D2R/mods/journey/journey.mpq`
3) Create a shortcut of the game exe, or activate additional command line arguments in BattleNet launcher
4) Add `-mod journey -txt`
5) Enjoy!
